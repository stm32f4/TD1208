= Version 1.0.0 =
  * Initial revision

= Version 1.0.1 =
  * N/A

= Version 1.0.2 =
  * Fixed bug in RF going back to sleep with RF chip version 1B
  * Changed TD_LAN frame length to 21 bytes in order to contain a SIGFOX frame
  * Changed RF chip SPI write access method
  * Changed result of SIGFOX "SFV;" to "02OK;" (SIGFOX version 2)
  * Changed SIGFOX RF IRQ to match TD_LAN
  * Added control on keep-alive max value + missing keep-alive message when setting null period
  * Added control on keep-alive retries mac value
  * Added random to frequency hoping seed value
  * Added TD_LAN_Release() to release the RF for SIGFOX transmission
  * Added TD_SIGFOX_FrequencyConf() and TD_SIGFOX_FrequencySet() to set SIGFOX operating frequency
  * Added TD_SIGFOX_MainRfPower() to setup SIGFOX max power
  * Added TS_SIGFOX_VersionLib() to get the libtdrf library version
  * Provision for 169 MHz support (not yet available)

= Version 2.0.0 =
  * Added TD_LAN_Restart(), TD_LAN_Process(), TD_LAN_SetFrequencyLevel() and TD_LAN_ReadLatchedRSSI() to public API
  * Added TD_SIGFOX_RelayId()
  * Added AT_LAN AT parser extension
  * Added AT_LAN AT parser extension
  
= Version 3.0.0 =
  
#### Major Updates ####
  
 * Supports modules with SIGFOX ID >= 0x10000 (still retaining compatibility with smaller 16 bit IDs)
 * Now supports SIGFOX protocol V1 by default
 
#### Changes ####

##### BOOTLOADER: #####

  * Added TD_BOOT_ConfigureRadio() for performing the intial RF chip configuration
  * Added TD_BOOT_Exec_InitData() for performing the initial GPIO configuration
    
##### LAN: #####

  * Moved GET() macro to libtdcore utils as GET_BITFIELD()
  * Moved SET() maro to  libtdcore utils as SET_BITFIELD()
  * Added TD_LAN_GetUserCallback()
  * Added TD_LAN_ReadLatchedRSSI()
  * Added TD_LAN_LastError()
  * Added TD_LAN_GetFrequency()
  * Added TD_LAN_GetPowerLevel()
  * Added TD_LAN_isActive()
                  
##### SIGFOX: #####

  * Added TD_SIGFOX_PowerVoltageExtended() to get the supply voltage while transmitting with a better accuracy
  * Removed the non-API function TD_SIGFOX_FrequencySet()
  * Renamed the non-API function TD_SIGFOX_MainRfPower() to TD_SIGFOX_RfPower()
  * Removed the non-API function TD_SIGFOX_RelayId() as it is non longer possible to relay SIGFFOX IDs with SIGFOX protocol v1
        
#### Bug Fixes ####

##### RF: #####

  * Bulletproof handling of RF chip mode (sleep/Idle/Receive/Transmit) transitions

##### LAN: #####

  * Major rewrite of LAN functions, it is heavily recommended to not mix devices with a `libtdrf` library older than v4.0.0
  * Better error handling and reporting

##### BOOTLOADER: #####

  * Extension of the bootloader to provide customization parameters: LED status pin location, optional update blink indication, RF channel selection, etc.
